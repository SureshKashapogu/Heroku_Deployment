# Heroku_Deployment
Model Deployment using Heroku
I have taken a Heart Stroke prediction dataset with dependent variables like age,bmi,blood glucose level,job type etc and built a simple classification model.
Using the Flask framework, I have tried deploying the model in the local environment as well as in the Heroku which is Platform as a service(PAAS) for ML Models.
